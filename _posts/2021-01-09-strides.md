I did it!  My website is my own - not a bit of me smashed into Red Owl!  I realized that the Red Owl format just wasn't me so I took the leap and spent (a very well spent) $19 on the [Ã‰toile](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/etoile-jekyll-blog-theme) theme.

What I accomplished

- Customized my website to be my own
- Consolidated blog posts into one place
- Set up new FLickr account to host my photos specifically for this site
- directed my site to rockman.life intead of the default emmyoop.github.io

I'm definitely hitting a stride that I need to try to ride.  The next short term goal I want to tackle is to pick my next Kaggle competition!
